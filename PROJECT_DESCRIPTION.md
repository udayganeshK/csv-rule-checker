# Project Description

## Intent

This project is intended for use in Krulz evaluation. When a CSV file is being modified and used to evaluate a particular code or action, this tool can automate the testing process and perform isolation tests. 

## What It Can Do

- Automate validation and testing of CSV files against defined rules
- Enable isolation testing without requiring the entire application setup
- Simplify the testing process for both technical and non-technical users

## Motivation

By using this tool, you no longer need to set up and run the whole application just to test changes in CSV files. This makes it easier and faster to validate data and logic, especially for non-technical team members who want to participate in testing.

## Key Features

- Rule-based validation of CSV files
- Streamlined, user-friendly interface via Streamlit
- Supports both automated and manual testing workflows

## Future Improvements

- Support for more complex rule definitions
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Enhanced reporting and
